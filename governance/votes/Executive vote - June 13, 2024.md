- **Proposal:** [Forum Post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposed-housekeeping-items-upcoming-executive-spell-2024-04-18/24084/4)
		
If this executive proposal passes, following the recommendation of the Governance Facilitators in collaboration with the spell team, the following operations will be performed:
		
- Raise `PSM-PAX-A` Debt Ceiling to **2,000 DAI**
- Call push(uint256 amt) on `MCD_PSM_PAX_A_INPUT_CONDUIT_JAR` with an `amt` of **1,159 USDP**

- Set `PSM-PAX-A` Debt Ceiling to **0 DAI**
		
This will have the following net results:
		
- **Debt Ceiling** remains at **0 DAI** after the transaction has been executed.
- Dai generated from `PSM_PAX_A` increases by **1,159 DAI**.
